Therefore, of the 5,100 unique items in the *test* set, only 5,100 - 373 = 4737 items are also present in the *sales_train* set.

Therfore, our model will need to predict sales for a very large number of items at shops that have no recorded history of selling that item previously.

Do we train our model for the 111,404 shop-item pairs that are in both the *test* and the *sales_train* sets, and predict 0 sales for the shop-item pairs that historically have not existed?  Or, perhaps we assign weights so that the in some way the *test* set's novel pairs are treated differently? </br> Is it possible that certain shops lag other shops in obtaining items for sale.  For the novel *test* set pairs we should look to predict from our model by extrapolating *sales_train* data from similar shops and items in previous months.  It could help to have a \"similarity\" metric between each of the shop-item pairs in the *test* set and each of the shop-item pairs in the *sales_train* set, and use this metric to restrict which shop-item pairs in the *sales_train* set are useful for predicting the sales of novel shop-item pairs in the *test* set.\n","\n","2.  Do we use the full *sales_train* dataset to train our model, or do we eliminate certain rows that pertain to irrelevant shop_id or item_id or shop-item pairs?\n","</br>\n","The *shops* dataframe is only 60 rows, so it shouldn't be too hard to analyze manually and see if we can find some sort of data leak that allows us to use only a subset of the shops when training our model.  We should certainly keep all *sales_train* data pertaining to the 42 shops in the *test* set, but how much of the data from the other 18 shops should we use to train our model?\n","\n","3.  Because we will be predicting future sales of 373 items of which we have no record of ever being sold, we will need to rely heavily on item category or other similarities with items that we *do* have in our *sales_train* set"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"4tqIxzAUsCir"},"source":["##2.2) Detailed Investigation of Descriptive Data Sets\n","\n","**Optional Section**\n","\n","*  Russian-to-English Translation\n","*  *shops* data set\n","*  *item_categories* data set\n","*  *items* data set\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZsGXSO99u2TB","colab_type":"text"},"source":["###2.2.1) ***shops*** Dataset: EDA and Feature Generation\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"WHeMPLFk0rOB"},"source":["#####2.2.1.1) **Translate and Ruminate**\n","We will start by translating the Russian text in the dataframe, and add our ruminations on possible new features we can generate.\n","\n","The dataframe shops_transl (equivalent to shops + 'column for English translation') is saved as a .csv file so we do not have to repeat the translation process the next time we open a Google Colab runtime."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"CHYWpvTt0EbW"},"source":["**Tip**\n","</br>\n","If you want to run this code to generate translated features for the shops, be sure to install the googletrans package and import Translator as in code above\n","\n","If you have already created and saved this data, save time by importing the modified csv datafile and you won't have to re-run the translating.

(e.g., 'Call of Duty III' vs. 'Call of Duty III DVD')\n","\n","One can expect that these two items would have similar sales in general, and by grouping them into a single feature category, we can eliminate some of the overfitting that might come as a result of the relatively small ratio of (training set shop-item-date combinations = 2935849)/(total number of unique items = 22170).  (This is an average of about 132 rows in the sales_train data for each shop-item-date combination that we are using to train our model.  Our task is to produce a monthly estimate of sales (for November 2015), so it is relevant to consider training our model based on how many sales in a month vs. how many sales in the entire training set.  Given that the sales_train dataset covers the time period from January 2013 to October 2015 (34 months), we have on average fewer than 4 shop-item combinations in our training set for a given item in any given month.  Furthermore, as we are trying to predict for a particular month (*November* 2015), it is relevant to consider how many rows in our training set occur in the month of November.  The sales_train dataset contains data for two 'November' months out of the total 34 months of data.  Another simple calculation gives us an estimate that our training set contains on average 0.23 shop-item combinations per item for November months.\n","\n","To summarize:\n","\n","*  *sales_train* contains 34 months of data, including 2935849 shop-item-date combinations\n","*  *items* contains 22170 \"unique\" item_id values\n","\n","In the *sales_train* data, we therefore have:\n","*  on average, 132 rows with a given shop-item pair for a given item_id\n","*  on average, 4 rows with a given shop-item pair for a given item_id in a given month\n","*  on average, 0.23 rows with a given shop-item pair for a given item_id in all months named 'November'\n","\n","If we wish to improve our model predictions for the following month of November, it behooves us to use monthly grouping of sales, or, even better, November grouping of sales.  This smooths out day-to-day variations in sales for a better monthly prediction.  However, the sparse number of available rows in the *sales_train* data will contribute to inaccuracy in our model training and predictions.\n","\n","Imagine if we could reduce the number of item_id values from 22170 to perhaps half that or even less.  Given that the number of rows for training (per item, on a monthly or a November basis) is so small, then such a reduction in the number of item_id values would have a big impact.  (The same is true for creating features to supplement \"shop_id\" so as to group and reduce the individuality of each shop - and thus effectively create, on average, more rows of training data for each shop-item pair."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FhHSfXNxsKxQ","colab_type":"code","outputId":"30020a2f-2771-4a70-86ab-1bc6c8e35dc7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587682819007,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":616,"user":{"displayName":"Michael Gaidis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhePD6jAHDISTPR4NIxczUMyvKb_tUrKiPQtlZeog=s64","userId":"15986747394900387491"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204}},"source":["items_transl.info()"],"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 22170 entries, 0 to 22169\n","Data columns (total 4 columns):\n"," #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype \n","---  ------            --------------  ----- \n"," 0   item_name         22170 non-null  object\n"," 1   item_id           22170 non-null  int64 \n"," 2   item_category_id  22170 non-null  int64 \n"," 3   En_name           22170 non-null  object\n","dtypes: int64(2), object(2)\n","memory usage: 692.9+ KB\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xdQUBtRHYiEJ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["It appears as though only 21807 out of 22170 possible item_ids are present in the training set.
