I definitely think the val data should come from the last xx months, where xx= 1 to 6, depending on size of dataset, and month range of truncated data set.\n","* **Possible Model Split or Additional Feature**... Consider sales variance by_year or by_2years (instead of by_month) for items with low price, vs. variance for items with high price... (or, low/high sales)... sales trends could be different enough that we might benefit from adding such a feature, or from training multiple models with training/val/test data split according to the focus of each model. </br> Based on the graphics of feature importance generated by Andreas, I'm not sure this is a big issue, but if I'm understanding correctly, the std is only calculated on a monthly grouping, and not on the entire sales_train set.

Need to first check the months at 11, 12, 13 before the test month, to make sure shop opening, or item for sale is not a seasonal thing.\n","* **Weighting for shops based on integral of sales**... The thought is that Andreas' feature importance plot shows trend-based features to be of minor importance, so it may be more relevant to look at trend-based features where final month (or two or three) have zero sales vs. those that have trends without zero sales. (e.g., if zero sales for months 30-33, or if 500 sales for months 30-33, you have same trend, but would want to make very different predictions... so trend may be more relevant when combining with some knowledge about number of sales, like a feature = \"trend x total sales.\"  (i.e., the integral of sales rather than the slope of sales).  This might be simply done with pandas' \"rolling\" method.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"88vnjiHjIk5k"},"source":["####3. **Feature Adjustment**\n","* **Re-Scale the Stats-Based Features**... perhaps not important for decision tree models, but other models will probably benefit by scaling everything to the same range (perhaps int16 or uint16). Or, scale to slightly different ranges, based on intuition of feature importance.  Sales by shop_item pair per month is likely more important than sales by item_cat3 per month, yet the latter is presently substantially larger than the former.\n","* **Better encoding for categorical features**... instead of a random-ordinal encoding or a pure ordinal encoding, we should reduce the influence of encoding on feature behavior. Consider mean-encoding or sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher or TensorFlow embedded categorization to keep number of features down? Could be more memory-friendly than one-hot encoding.\n","* **Workdays and Holidays per month** ... Adjust item_cnt_day by number of days in month block; also adjust for holidays and weekends, if it is clear there are no sales on such days.  Or, give different weight to sales on weekends or holidays if we see these dominate the sales vs. if they have very few sales. (Scale by number of weekends/holidays in each month vs. Nov. 2015).  Need to do further EDA first, to see if there really is a deviation of sales on these non-standard days, probably using original dataset grouped by shop_id.</br>\n","Also need to check on monthly behavior... months like December, January, and February may behave differently than other months because of Christmas and because of the large concentration of Russian holidays.  It could make sense to scale the sales of these months so they fit better the overall trends of sales from October to March.  In this way, we feed the model a better-behaved dataset that is not overly influenced by crazy months (particularly, since we are given November as test, and will validate on \"smooth\" months like October, or Sept+Oct, or Aug+Sept+Oct... and won't be doing any test/val on crazy months)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"9gjvmWf3Ilmu"},"source":["####4. **Data Memory Requirements and Model Training Time**\n","* **Expanding the Number of Rows in Test/Val**...

This is primarily because categorical groupings give certain shop-item pairs relevance even if they are not in the train or test sets. </br>\n","\n","* Because we have shops and items categorically grouped, we can infer certain things about a previously-unseen shop-item pair, by using the behavior of the shops and items in the same categories.\n","* To train in anticipation of being able to predict all test set shop-item pairs, the model needs to be scored on a train dataset that has all of the test set's shop-item pairs in each time period, with proper estimates of values that may need to be interpolated.  \n","** If we make the simplest assumption of zero sales for any shop-item pair not present in the sales_train dataset, we can just fill with 0 for any of the sales_by columns for the new cartesian product rows.\n","** If we use 'price' or one of its functional aggregates as a feature, things get more complicated, as it probably is not ideal to set price = 0 when adding the new cartesian product rows.  We need to infer or interpolate if we plan to use price-based features in our model.\n","** An alternative to manually interpolating is to train a preliminary model for months \\< 34, and use the preliminary model(s) to make predictions for what sales counts should be used for the new cartesian product rows.  You might have one model for every aggregate feature, for example, or you could combine several of these features as \"target\" predictions in a single model.\n","* Similarly, it is important for the validation set to be scored based on predictions for all relevant shop-item pairs, and not just the shop-item pairs present in the sales_train dataset.\n","* We do not need to add cartesian product rows to month 34, because the model only considers single row inputs, and not chunks of rows as inputs. (Although this is a possible model variant... feeding it a group of correlated rows that are not already correlated by aggregate features... then the model has nrows times as many \"feature inputs\" to deal with)\n","\n","</br>\n","\n","What makes a shop-item pair relevant to add using cartesian product?:\n","* Shop focus:\n","* 1.
