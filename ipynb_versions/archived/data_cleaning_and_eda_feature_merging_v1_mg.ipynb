If one or two of the 4 groupings are substantially higher importance upon training, then suggest you do not use the other 2 or 3 category groupings as features at all. (There is *some* correlation between the categories of two different grouping methods, but I would be concerned that there are also anti-correlations between the different feature variants, and that it is not straightforward for the model to resolve conflicting category information.  I'm guessing that the best results would come from using one or two of the \"broad\" category groupings (cat3 or cat4) and one (and only one) of the \"finer\" category groupings (the original 84-category feature, or the weighted 2000ish-category cluster_code feature)\n","\n","2.  **Shops inclusion and feature priority**:</br>\n","* I suspect *shop_federal_district* will not have a great importance in the training, but I would be interested to see if you find the same conclusion after training and looking at relative feature importance.  Although I'm also including *shop_city* as a possible feature to use, I don't recommend this unless you have plenty of time/computing resources.  If you can, give it a try, and see if it actually does have significant feature importance.\n","* I am dropping shops 9 and 13 from the training set due to their odd behavior and because they are not in the test set.  I don't think there will be worse model performance because of this (I suspect actually it could be significantly better), but if time permits, it would be worth double-checking this hypothesis by training the model with these two shops still in the *sales_train* data set, and see if you see any model improvement.\n","* Similarly, the merging / removal of shops 0, 1, and 11 is being done on a hunch that the similarity of these 3 untested shops with their (tested) merge partners is so strong that the merging to create more data for training tested shops will be beneficial.  The issue is that I have not done a deep dive into the aforementioned similarity.  There is a possibility that this merging of shops could distort the training behavior of time lag, item_id, or item_category if the shop 'similiarity' is not strong enough.  For example,  the 3 shop merges could create a substantially different sales distribution of items/categories/time for the 3 shops being tested. A shallow exploration suggests it's not an issue, but I'm not 100% confident, and we should consider poentially running the model training without merging these shops together.  (The good news is I don't think the 3 merges will have much effect, if any, on any of the other shops.)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ruw_WyRxhqpx"},"source":["#0.1 Configure Environment\n","**NOT OPTIONAL**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sTVAxnMnenrB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1589288819240,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":444,"user":{"displayName":"Michael Gaidis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhePD6jAHDISTPR4NIxczUMyvKb_tUrKiPQtlZeog=s64","userId":"15986747394900387491"}},"outputId":"90fa4167-7dc9-4a6f-d2c2-1ad86841efac","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51}},"source":["# General python libraries/modules used throughout the notebook\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from matplotlib.ticker import MultipleLocator, FormatStrFormatter, AutoMinorLocator\n","import numpy as np\n","from scipy import sparse\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from numba import jit, prange\n","import networkx as nx\n","from networkx.algorithms import community, cluster\n","\n","import os\n","from itertools import product\n","import re\n","import json\n","import time\n","from time import sleep, localtime, strftime\n","import pickle\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","\n","\n","# Magics\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","\n","# NLP packages\n","import nltk\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer \n","lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer() \n","\n","# # ML packages\n","# from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","\n","# !pip install catboost\n","# from catboost import CatBoostRegressor \n","\n","# %tensorflow_version 2.x\n","# import tensorflow as tf\n","# import keras as K\n","\n","# # List of the modules we need to version-track for reference\n","modules = ['pandas','matplotlib','numpy','scipy','numba','seaborn','sklearn','tensorflow','keras','catboost','pip','nltk','networkx']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NoOf7oi8Oe-Q"},"source":["# Notebook formatting\n","# Adjust as per your preferences.
