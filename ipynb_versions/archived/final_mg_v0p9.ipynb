Process Pools   https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html\n","# One can create a pool of processes which will carry out tasks submitted to it with the Pool class.\n","# class multiprocessing.Pool([processes[, initializer[, initargs[, maxtasksperchild]]]])\n","# processes is the number of worker processes to use. If processes is None then the number returned by cpu_count() is used. If initializer is not None then each worker process will call initializer(*initargs) when it starts.\n","# Note that the methods of the pool object should only be called by the process which created the pool.\n","# New in version 2.7: maxtasksperchild is the number of tasks a worker process can complete before it will exit and be replaced with a fresh worker process, to enable unused resources to be freed. \n","# The default maxtasksperchild is None, which means worker processes will live as long as the pool.\n","\n","# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39100971/how-do-i-release-memory-used-by-a-pandas-dataframe/39101287#39101287\n","# There is one thing that always works, however, because it is done at the OS, not language, level.\n","# Suppose you have a function that creates an intermediate huge DataFrame, and returns a smaller result (which might also be a DataFrame):\n","# >     def huge_intermediate_calc(something):\n","# >         ...\n","# >         huge_df = pd.DataFrame(...)\n","# >         ...\n","# >         return some_aggregate\n","# Then if you do something like:\n","# >     import multiprocessing\n","# >     result = multiprocessing.Pool(1).map(huge_intermediate_calc, [something_])[0]\n","# Then the function is executed at a different process. When that process completes, the OS retakes all the resources it used. \n","# Maybe it help someone, when creating the Pool try to use maxtasksperchild = 1\n","# In an iPython environment (like jupyter notebook), you need to .close() and .join() or .terminate() the pool to get rid of the spawned process. \n","# The easiest way of doing that since Python 3.3 is to use the context management protocol: \n","# >     with multiprocessing.Pool(1) as pool: \n","# >         result = pool.map(huge_intermediate_calc, [something])\n","# Another option is for the subprocess to write the dataframe to disk using something like parquet. \n","#    It may be faster than moving a big pickled dataframe back to the parent. It will be in the disk cache so it is fast. \n","# If you stick to numeric numpy arrays, those are freed, but boxed object types are not.\n","# When modifying your dataframe, prefer inplace=True, so you don't create copies.\n","\n","#  Use PIPE to concatenate functions in a multiprocess pool, keeping workers / dataframes all within the process so it kills them when the process terminates\n","# The Pipe() function returns a pair of connection objects connected by a pipe which by default is duplex (two-way). For example:\n","# from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe\n","# def f(conn):\n","#     conn.send([42, None, 'hello'])\n","#     conn.close()\n","# if __name__ == '__main__':\n","#     parent_conn, child_conn = Pipe()\n","#     p = Process(target=f, args=(child_conn,))\n","#     p.start()\n","#     print parent_conn.recv()   # prints \"[42, None, 'hello']\"\n","#     p.join()\n","# parent,child = multiprocessing.Pipe()\n","\n","# with multiprocessing.Pool(None,maxtasksperchild = 1) as pool:  # None = use all available processors, could use Pool(1, maxtasksperchild = 1)\n","#     result = pool.map(load_dfs, [args])[0]\n","# pool.close()  # pool.terminate()\n","# pool.join()   \n","\n","# gc.collect()\n","#print(parent.recv())\n","#child.close()\n","#print(f'Result = {result[:5]}') #.head(2))\n","#print(f'Result = {result[:5]}') #.head(2))\n","#print(result.head(2))\n","#result = 1.0\n","#print(f'Result = {result}') #.head(2))\n","# del result\n","# gc.collect()\n","# result = pd.DataFrame()  # doesn't seem to help immediately, nor does \"del df\" or put df in list and \"del list\" or \"del list[0]\" or \"del list[0] --> del list\", all followed by gc.collect()\n","# pool.close(); pool.join();  mu,vu,vt,va,t = get_memory_stats(\"4) After checking active children: \")  # pool.terminate()\n","# gc.collect(); mu,vu,vt,va,t = get_memory_stats(\"5) After gc.collect(): \")\n","# %reset Out   # flush the output cache (no obvious improvement with IPynb)\n","# gc.collect(); mu,vu,vt,va,t = get_memory_stats(\"6) After Reset Cache and gc.collect(): \")\n","\n","                # \"readonly/final_project_data/test.csv.gz\",\n","                # \"data_output/train_test_base.csv.gz\"]\n","\n","# dummy test program to verify OK to run with multiprocessing (yes; it releases memory when parent process is done)\n","# def print_tail(df=pd.DataFrame()):\n","#     print(df.tail(2))\n","#     return df\n","#             exec(data_frame_name + ' = print_tail(' + data_frame_name + ')')\n","#         df = print_tail(eval(data_frame_name)) ;  arg_dict['q'].put(df)  #(df.tail(1))\n","#         arg_dict['q'].put(eval(data_frame_name)) # very slow to try passing full dfs by queue\n","# q = multiprocessing.Queue(len(data_files))  # optional argument: length of queue\n","# proc = multiprocessing.Process(target=load_dfs, args=(args_dict,))\n","# proc.start()\n","# proc.join()  # waits for queue to be filled/flushed\n","# mu,vu,vt,va,t = get_memory_stats(\"C) After Close and Join Pool: \")\n","# print(q.get().head(1))\n","# print(items_enc.head(2))\n","# print(q.get().head(1))\n","# print(shops_enc.head(2))\n","# print(q.get().head(1))\n","# print(date_adjustments.head(2))\n","# print(q.get().head(1))\n","# print(test.head(2))\n","# print(q.get().head(1))\n","# print(train_test_base.head(2))\n","\n","nocode=True"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]}]}
