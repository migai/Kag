For the novel *test* set pairs we should look to predict from our model by extrapolating *sales_train* data from similar shops and items in previous months.  It could help to have a \"similarity\" metric between each of the shop-item pairs in the *test* set and each of the shop-item pairs in the *sales_train* set, and use this metric to restrict which shop-item pairs in the *sales_train* set are useful for predicting the sales of novel shop-item pairs in the *test* set.\n","\n","2.

(e.g., 'Call of Duty III' vs. 'Call of Duty III DVD')\n","\n","One can expect that these two items would have similar sales in general, and by grouping them into a single feature category, we can eliminate some of the overfitting that might come as a result of the relatively small ratio of (training set shop-item-date combinations = 2935849)/(total number of unique items = 22170).  (This is an average of about 132 rows in the sales_train data for each shop-item-date combination that we are using to train our model.  Our task is to produce a monthly estimate of sales (for November 2015), so it is relevant to consider training our model based on how many sales in a month vs. how many sales in the entire training set.  Given that the sales_train dataset covers the time period from January 2013 to October 2015 (34 months), we have on average fewer than 4 shop-item combinations in our training set for a given item in any given month.  Furthermore, as we are trying to predict for a particular month (*November* 2015), it is relevant to consider how many rows in our training set occur in the month of November.  The sales_train dataset contains data for two 'November' months out of the total 34 months of data.  Another simple calculation gives us an estimate that our training set contains on average 0.23 shop-item combinations per item for November months.\n","\n","To summarize:\n","\n","*  *sales_train* contains 34 months of data, including 2935849 shop-item-date combinations\n","*  *items* contains 22170 \"unique\" item_id values\n","\n","In the *sales_train* data, we therefore have:\n","*  on average, 132 rows with a given shop-item pair for a given item_id\n","*  on average, 4 rows with a given shop-item pair for a given item_id in a given month\n","*  on average, 0.23 rows with a given shop-item pair for a given item_id in all months named 'November'\n","\n","If we wish to improve our model predictions for the following month of November, it behooves us to use monthly grouping of sales, or, even better, November grouping of sales.  This smooths out day-to-day variations in sales for a better monthly prediction.  However, the sparse number of available rows in the *sales_train* data will contribute to inaccuracy in our model training and predictions.\n","\n","Imagine if we could reduce the number of item_id values from 22170 to perhaps half that or even less.
