Directory to hold utility files for ease of import into, and readability of, ipynb notebooks

As of now, "kaggle_utils_at_mg.py" is just a dummy test file with a simple function in it to check for proper loading into Google Colab

.

"template_for_Clone_GitHub_to_GDrive.ipynb" is the setup notebook to begin the cloning process from this repository to your personal Google Drive

See, for example, "Kag/ipynb_versions/MG_EDA_Kaggle_Coursera_Final_Assignment.ipynb" for details on how you would then use a Colab Jupyter notebook to 
1) load the cloned files from your Google Drive into Colab
2) save files from Colab to your Google Drive
3) use some git functions to sync your Google Drive's files with this "Kag" GitHub repository
