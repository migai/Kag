# kaggle_coursera
Coursera's Competitive Data Science course, taught by NRU-HSE

Team:  Andreas Theodoulou and Michael Gaidis

.

Data files for the final competition reside in the readonly/final_project_data directory

.

Kaggle_Coursera_Final_Assignment.ipynb is (at present) a starter notebook that aids in using Google Colab, by loading all data and code helper files from this GitHub repository into the Colab environment
This should be forked and used at your discretion

.

There is a "kaggle_utils_at_mg.py" starter file in the master directory as well.  This is (at present) just a template for how we could store snippets of code to make our Jupyter notebooks more readable.
